# CML_processing_by_ML
Codes to train a Fully Conv. Net. on 15 sec 2-channels attenuations.

- notebooks:
    - looks how fcn work on simulated data (blabla.ipynb)
    - see how our networks are causal
    - get network characteristics (nb of parameters, FLOPs)
    - see how figures have been obtained

- dependencies:
    - see transforms, pytorch Datasets objects, architecture details and cost functions 

- train_1GPU: the simplest training procedure
